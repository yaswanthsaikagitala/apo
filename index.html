            <div class="words line1">To: Geetha</div>
            <div class="words line2">Hey Geetha,</div>
            <div class="words line3">I want to say this honestly and with a calm heart.</div>
            <div class="words line4">I’m sorry if my words or actions made you feel pressured or overwhelmed. That was never what I wanted.</div>
            <div class="words line5">I was acting from care and, yes, from being in love, but I understand now that even love can feel heavy when someone is confused or trying to protect themselves.</div>
            <div class="words line6">My feelings for you are real, but I also respect your feelings and your pace. I don’t want you to feel like you owe me anything not replies, not clarity, not effort. You don’t.</div>
            <div class="words line7">What matters to me is that you feel safe, respected, and free to be yourself.</div>
            <div class="words line8">If at any point I crossed a boundary or made things harder for you, I’m truly sorry. I’m learning that loving someone also means giving them space, patience, and understanding  even when it’s difficult.</div>
            <div class="words line9">No expectations from this message. I just wanted to be honest about my feelings and apologize where I should have.</div>
            <div class="words line10">Take care,</div>
